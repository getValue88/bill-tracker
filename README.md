# Bill Tracker

A cross-platform personal finance helper built with **Next.js 14**, **Prisma** and **Electron**.  Keep track of every bill, note and attachment in one place — in the browser or as a native desktop app.

---

## ✨ Feature Highlights

### Bills
* Inline-editable amount and paid/unpaid toggle
* Due-date, created-date & automatic monthly totals
* Recurring bills (monthly / quarterly / yearly) generated by a scheduler
* Optional payment link – name becomes a hyperlink that opens in a new tab
* File attachments per bill (receipts, PDFs)
* Search by text, filter by month & status, sub-navigation with live totals

### Notes
* Rich-text notes that can be attached to anything or stand alone
* Resolve / undo resolve, archive / unarchive
* Drag-and-drop ordering powered by **@hello-pangea/dnd**
* Sticky (pinned) notes sit at the top

### Reports
* Monthly expenditure bar chart
* Current-month summary (total vs paid)

### Quality-of-life
* Dark-mode friendly UI with Tailwind + Headless UI
* Keyboard-navigable components & accessible modals
* JSON logging via **pino**

### Tech
* Next.js App Router + Server Actions
* Prisma ORM with SQLite (dev/offline) & PostgreSQL ready for production
* Electron wrapper – runs the same build in a native window
* TypeScript everywhere

## 🔧 Getting Started (Browser)

```bash
# 1. Clone & install (runs `postinstall` which executes `prisma generate` automatically)
git clone https://github.com/<your>/bill-tracker.git
cd bill-tracker
npm install  # generates Prisma client

# 2. Database – create & apply migrations
npx prisma migrate dev --name init

# 3. Seed recurring demo data (optional)
npm run test-recurring

# 4. Run the dev server
npm run dev
# → http://localhost:3000
```

Environment variables live in `.env` (create one from `.env.example` if needed).

## 🖥️ Running as a Desktop App (Electron)

The repository already contains an Electron main process under `electron/`.

### Development mode

```bash
# Hot-reload Next.js + Electron in one go
npm run electron:dev
```

### Production build / installer

```bash
# 1. Build the Next.js app
npm run build

# 2. Package for your OS (DMG/EXE/AppImage, etc.)
# If you are on Windows and the build fails with a symbolic-link or
# `EPERM` error, reopen PowerShell **as Administrator** (or enable
# "Developer Mode" in Windows settings) and run:
#   npm run electron:build
#
# After a successful build the installer is written to the `dist/` folder.
#   • Windows:  `dist/ Bill Tracker Setup <version>.exe`
#   • macOS   :  `dist/ *.dmg`
#   • Linux   :  `dist/ *.AppImage`, `.deb`, etc. depending on targets
npm run electron:build
```

Under the hood this uses **electron-builder** so macOS, Windows and Linux targets are supported.
